# README: Understanding Our App's Routes and Models

Hello! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to our app's README! This document will help you understand what our app does through its routes and models.

## What is a Route?

In our app, a route is like a special path that helps us go to different places and do different things. Each route does something specific when we visit it.

## Important Routes in Our App

### 1. Home Page (/)

This route is like our app's front door. When you open our app, you'll see the home page. It's like the first page of a book where you start reading.

### 2. Login Page (/login)

Imagine this route as a secret door that only opens if you know the right words (username and password). It helps you get into the app by checking who you are.

### 3. Logout Page (/logout)

Once you're inside the app, this route helps you leave whenever you're done. It's like saying "bye-bye" and closing the secret door behind you.

### 4. Products Page (/products)

This route shows you all the cool things we have in our app. It's like a big toy store where you can see all the toys (or products) we have to play with.

### 5. Order Page (/order/<product_id>)

This route lets you pick something you like from the toy store (products page). When you click on something, it's like telling us you want to take it home. This route helps us make sure you get what you want.

## What is a Model?

In our app, models are like special boxes that hold important information about things. Each box keeps different types of information organized so we can use them when we need to.

## Important Models in Our App

### 1. User Model

The User model is like a box that keeps information about people using our app. It knows each person's username, password, and other details that help us recognize who you are when you log in.

### 2. Product Model

The Product model is like a box that holds information about all the fun things we have in our app. It knows each product's name, description, and price so we can show them to you on the products page.

### 3. Order Model

The Order model is like a box that helps us keep track of what you want to take home from the toy store (products page). It knows who ordered something and when they ordered it.

### 4. OrderProduct Model

The OrderProduct model is like a special link between the Order and Product models. It helps us connect which products you ordered with which order. It's like making sure the right toys go to the right homes.
